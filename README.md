### < Setting The Viewport >

HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the **`<meta>`** tag.

You should include the following **`<meta>`** viewport element in all your web pages:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The **`width=device-width`** part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The **`initial-scale=1.0`** part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
